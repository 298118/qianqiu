# Shared AI Development Context

This file is the handoff board shared by Codex and Claude Code.

Both tools must read this file at the start of every development session, after reading their own instruction file. Both tools must update this file whenever they make a meaningful project change, so the other tool can immediately see the current state without relying on chat history.

## Current Snapshot

- Repository status: documentation scaffold only; game implementation has not started.
- Canonical product brief: `docs/QIANQIU_DEVELOPMENT_BRIEF.md`.
- Shared implementation roadmap and progress ledger: `docs/DEVELOPMENT_STEPS.md`.
- Codex entrypoint: `AGENTS.md`.
- Claude Code entrypoint: `CLAUDE.md`.
- Default development target: runnable Node.js + Express + pure HTML/CSS/JS game at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Default AI mode: `mock`, playable without API keys.

## Active Decisions

- Use one shared context file for both Codex and Claude Code: `docs/SHARED_CONTEXT.md`.
- Use one shared step ledger for both Codex and Claude Code: `docs/DEVELOPMENT_STEPS.md`.
- Every coherent project change must be committed locally with Git.
- Any behavior/API/setup/architecture decision that affects future work must be recorded in this file or in the canonical development brief.
- Any roadmap step that starts, completes, blocks, or changes scope must be recorded in `docs/DEVELOPMENT_STEPS.md`.
- If the change is a short handoff note, update this file.
- If the change alters product scope, architecture, API contracts, state shape, prompts, setup, or acceptance criteria, update both this file and the relevant durable document.

## Handoff Protocol

At the start of each session:

1. Read the tool-specific entrypoint: `AGENTS.md` for Codex or `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code.
2. Read this file.
3. Read `docs/QIANQIU_DEVELOPMENT_BRIEF.md` before planning or editing.
4. Read `docs/DEVELOPMENT_STEPS.md` and choose the next small step.
5. Run `git status --short`.
6. Respect any existing uncommitted changes.

Before finishing each coherent change:

1. Update this file with the new current state, decisions, verification notes, and next recommended step.
2. Update `docs/DEVELOPMENT_STEPS.md` with step status, completed work, verification, and commit hash.
3. Update `docs/QIANQIU_DEVELOPMENT_BRIEF.md` or README when the durable project contract changes.
4. Run the relevant verification command.
5. Commit the change locally.
6. Mention the commit hash in the final response.

## Latest Verification

- 2026-05-05: Documentation files were readable as UTF-8 through Node.js.
- 2026-05-05: Git repository initialized and documentation scaffold committed.
- 2026-05-05: Shared context bridge added; Node.js verification confirmed `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, README, and the development brief all link to `docs/SHARED_CONTEXT.md`.
- 2026-05-05: Development steps ledger added; Codex and Claude Code entrypoints now require updating `docs/DEVELOPMENT_STEPS.md` for every roadmap step.

## Next Recommended Step

Implement the first runnable vertical slice:

- `package.json`, `.env.example`, and `server.js`.
- Mock AI provider.
- `POST /api/game/start`.
- Static frontend shell that can start a scholar session.
